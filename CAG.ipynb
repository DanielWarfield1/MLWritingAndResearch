        "Franz Ferdinand are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 2002. Their original line-up was composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Nick McCarthy (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Bob Hardy (bass, percussion) and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Julian Corrie (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals) and Dino Bardot (guitar, backing vocals) joined the band in 2017 after McCarthy left during the previous year, and Audrey Tait (drums, percussion) joined the band after Thomson left in 2021. The band were categorised as a post-punk revival band and garnered multiple UK top 20 hits.[1] They have been nominated for several Grammy Awards and have received two Brit Awards—winning one for Best British Group—as well as one NME Award.\n",
        "\n",
        "The band's first single, \"Darts of Pleasure\", just missed out on the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 44. Their second single, \"Take Me Out\", proved their big commercial breakthrough, peaking at number three. \"Take Me Out\" charted in several other countries and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal; it became the band's signature song. Their debut album Franz Ferdinand won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2005, the band released their second studio album, You Could Have It So Much Better, produced by Rich Costey. It peaked within the top-ten in multiple countries and earned Grammy-nominations for Best Alternative Album and for one of the singles, \"Do You Want To\". The band's third studio album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, was released in January 2009; by then the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound to a more dance-oriented sound. A remix album of Tonight, titled Blood, was released in July 2009.\n",
        "\n",
        "Four years after the release of Tonight, the band released their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, in August 2013. In 2015, Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks formed the supergroup FFS and released a one-off album, FFS, in June 2015. The band underwent multiple line-up changes following FFS, beginning with McCarthy's departure in 2016. After acquiring Corrie and Bardot, the band released their fifth studio album Always Ascending in February 2018. Thomson departed in 2021 and was replaced by Tait. The band's sixth studio album, The Human Fear, was released in January 2025 to commercial success.\n",

        "The Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria inspired the band's name.\n",
        "The band's members played in various bands during the 1990s, including The Karelia, Yummy Fur, 10p Invaders, and Embryo. Alex Kapranos and Paul Thomson met at a party and began a close friendship and played together in Yummy Fur, and subsequently teamed up to write songs. Around the same time, Kapranos taught his friend Bob Hardy how to play bass after being given a bass by Mick Cooke of Belle & Sebastian. Kapranos met guitarist Nick McCarthy, who had returned to Scotland after studying jazz bass in Germany, in 2001.[2]\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the members came together, they settled on the name Franz Ferdinand for their band. The name was originally inspired by a racehorse called Archduke Ferdinand.[3] After seeing the horse win the Northumberland Plate in 2001, the band began to discuss Archduke Franz Ferdinand and thought it would be a good band name because of the alliteration of the name and the implications of the Archduke's death: his assassination was a significant factor in the lead-up to World War I.[4] In an interview, Hardy recollected that \"mainly we just liked the way it sounded. We liked the alliteration.\" Kapranos continued, saying \"he was an incredible figure as well. His life, or at least the ending of it, was the catalyst for the complete transformation of the world and that is what we want our music to be. But I don't want to over-intellectualise the name thing. Basically a name should just sound good ... like music.\" Thomson concluded, saying “I like the idea that, if we become popular, maybe the words Franz Ferdinand will make people think of the band instead of the historical figure.”[5]\n",

        "In May 2003 the band signed to Laurence Bell's independent record label, Domino Recording Company.[6] The band moved to Gula Studios in Malmö, Sweden, with Cardigans producer Tore Johansson to record their debut album. In the latter part of 2003, the band released their debut single, \"Darts of Pleasure\". In January 2004, the single \"Take Me Out\" reached No. 3 in the UK charts. The album, Franz Ferdinand, was released in early 2004, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart in February 2004, and at No. 12 in the Australian album charts in April 2004. The album only reached the lowest levels of the Billboard 200 album charts in the US as of early 2004, but reached the top 5 of the indie rock chart and the Heatseeker chart for debut artists. After a couple of North American tours and heavy rotation of the \"Take Me Out\" video on MTV, the album eventually reached No. 32 on the Billboard 200 later in 2004, and sold over a million copies in the United States.[2] Franz Ferdinand received a generally strong positive response from critics. NME rated it 9 out of 10, and said that the band was the latest in the line of art school rock bands featuring the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Roxy Music, the Sex Pistols, Wire, Travis and Blur.\n",
        "\n",
        "On 7 September 2004, the album was awarded the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. \"Take Me Out\" gained first place in the Australian Triple J Hottest 100 for 2004, winning more than twice the votes of the second-place entry, with This Fire and The Dark of the Matinee entering at No. 24 and No. 50 respectively. Franz Ferdinand won an Ivor Novello Award in 2004 and two Brit Awards in 2005. The avant-garde music video for \"Take Me Out\" earned them a Breakthrough Video MTV Award. NME named Franz Ferdinand the best album of 2004,[7] and placed it 38th on their 100 Best Albums of All Time list.[8] The band performed \"Take Me Out\" as a live medley with Los Lonely Boys, Maroon 5, The Black Eyed Peas and Gwen Stefani at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in 2005, in which \"Take Me Out\" was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Franz Ferdinand was nominated for Best Alternative Album. \"Take Me Out\" was featured on the video games NHL 2005, Madden NFL 2005 and the breakthrough game Guitar Hero. The album has sold around 3.6 million copies worldwide.\n",

        "The band spent much of 2005 in the studio in Glasgow working on their follow-up album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was released on 3 October 2005. The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut,[9] but they changed it to You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand before settling on the final title.[10] The album's cover design was modelled on Alexander Rodchenko's 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, \"There's more to life than disco-beat guitar music\".[2] It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics.[11] It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8. The album eventually sold 2 million copies worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "To support the album, four singles were released. Included in that set is a double A-side single that contained a video-clip-only single as well (both the AA-side \"L. Wells\" and the video-clip \"Jeremy Fraser\" are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band's tour of Australia in support of the album). Also included is another video-clip-only single called \"Wine, In the Afternoon\" which is the B-side to \"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\", and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan. \"Do You Want To\" made it to number 4 and was declared by Q to be the greatest single of 2005, while \"Walk Away\" and \"The Fallen\" entered the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart. The fourth and final single from the second album, \"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\", peaked at number 30. You Could Have It So Much Better went on to earn a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006, as did \"Do You Want To\" for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n",

Alex Kapranos has stated that \"The last record was...like a teenager having sex. This one's a bit more assured and a bit friendlier for the dance floor.\"[13] Tonight was mixed by Canadian Mix Engineer Mike Fraser.[14] The song \"Ulysses\" was chosen to be the first single and was released on 19 January 2009. It was first played by Zane Lowe on 17 November 2008. Shortly afterwards it hit YouTube.[15] It did not see that much success in the UK Top 40, reaching only No. 20, but it fared better in Spain and Japan where it reached No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. It also entered the Top 20 of the US Modern Rock Chart. The album, Tonight was released 26 January 2009 and debuted at No. 2 in the UK Album Chart and No. 9 in the US Billboard 200. The second single, \"No You Girls\" saw success both in the charts and on the radio prior to release, eventually reaching No. 7 on the US Modern Rock Chart and was performed by Franz Ferdinand on Comic Relief 2009 Top of The Pops special. \"Can't Stop Feeling\" was released on 6 July as the third single from the album and on 28 August, \"What She Came For\" was released as the 4th single in the form of a remix single. The band performed \"What She Came For\" on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien on Wednesday, 26 August 2009.[16]\n",

The tour included a set at the Coachella Festival.[18] The band were also one of the main stage acts performing at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Swindon in May. On 6 May 2009, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand would be the third opening act for the Green Day's 21st Century Breakdown World Tour.

In May 2012, the band returned to touring, playing several festivals during the summer of 2012 including a headlining slot at Field Day festival in London's Victoria Park.[22] Other appearances included Barcelona's Primavera Sound Festival, Montreal's 2012 Osheaga Music Festival, Chicago's 2012 Lollapalooza Music Festival, Belgium's Dour Festival, Portugal's Marés Vivas Festival and San Francisco's 2012 Outside Lands Music Festival.\n",

In early March they performed \"Evil Eye\" and \"Love Illumination\", while the end of the month saw the live premiere of \"Goodbye Lovers & Friends\". On 16 May 2013, Franz Ferdinand officially announced their fourth album, titled Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, along with cover art, track listing and a release date of 26 August 2013.[24] The band launched the new album at a show at the Electric Brixton.

Additionally, Franz Ferdinand recorded a cover of the Fire Engines' song \"Get Up and Use Me\". In return, the Fire Engines recorded a cover of \"Jacqueline\". The band also took a similar approach with Dutch band De Kift, covering the song \"Heisa-Ho\" whilst De Kift recorded a cover of \"Love and Destroy\" with Dutch lyrics.

Hot Chip, a band who are reported to be a favourite of Franz Ferdinand, also performed their own version of \"No\" on the same album. The band partnered with Sony in Tokyo, filming commercials for the launch of the A Series Walkman music player on 8 September 2005.[50][51] A limited edition Franz Ferdinand-themed Walkman A Series player was released by Sony Japan in January 2006, with only one hundred made.[52]\n",

        "Franz Ferdinand are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 2002. Their original line-up was composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Nick McCarthy (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Bob Hardy (bass, percussion) and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Julian Corrie (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals) and Dino Bardot (guitar, backing vocals) joined the band in 2017 after McCarthy left during the previous year, and Audrey Tait (drums, percussion) joined the band after Thomson left in 2021. The band were categorised as a post-punk revival band and garnered multiple UK top 20 hits.[1] They have been nominated for several Grammy Awards and have received two Brit Awards—winning one for Best British Group—as well as one NME Award.\n",
        "\n",
        "The band's first single, \"Darts of Pleasure\", just missed out on the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 44. Their second single, \"Take Me Out\", proved their big commercial breakthrough, peaking at number three. \"Take Me Out\" charted in several other countries and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal; it became the band's signature song. Their debut album Franz Ferdinand won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album.\n",

        "In 2005, the band released their second studio album, You Could Have It So Much Better, produced by Rich Costey. It peaked within the top-ten in multiple countries and earned Grammy-nominations for Best Alternative Album and for one of the singles, \"Do You Want To\". The band's third studio album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, was released in January 2009; by then the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound to a more dance-oriented sound. A remix album of Tonight, titled Blood, was released in July 2009.\n",
        "\n",
        "Four years after the release of Tonight, the band released their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, in August 2013. In 2015, Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks formed the supergroup FFS and released a one-off album, FFS, in June 2015. The band underwent multiple line-up changes following FFS, beginning with McCarthy's departure in 2016. After acquiring Corrie and Bardot, the band released their fifth studio album Always Ascending in February 2018. Thomson departed in 2021 and was replaced by Tait. The band's sixth studio album, The Human Fear, was released in January 2025 to commercial success.\n",

        "The band's members played in various bands during the 1990s, including The Karelia, Yummy Fur, 10p Invaders, and Embryo. Alex Kapranos and Paul Thomson met at a party and began a close friendship and played together in Yummy Fur, and subsequently teamed up to write songs. Around the same time, Kapranos taught his friend Bob Hardy how to play bass after being given a bass by Mick Cooke of Belle & Sebastian. Kapranos met guitarist Nick McCarthy, who had returned to Scotland after studying jazz bass in Germany, in 2001.[2]\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the members came together, they settled on the name Franz Ferdinand for their band. The name was originally inspired by a racehorse called Archduke Ferdinand.[3] After seeing the horse win the Northumberland Plate in 2001, the band began to discuss Archduke Franz Ferdinand and thought it would be a good band name because of the alliteration of the name and the implications of the Archduke's death: his assassination was a significant factor in the lead-up to World War I.[4] In an interview, Hardy recollected that \"mainly we just liked the way it sounded. We liked the alliteration.\" Kapranos continued, saying \"he was an incredible figure as well. His life, or at least the ending of it, was the catalyst for the complete transformation of the world and that is what we want our music to be. But I don't want to over-intellectualise the name thing. Basically a name should just sound good ... like music.\" Thomson concluded, saying “I like the idea that, if we become popular, maybe the words Franz Ferdinand will make people think of the band instead of the historical figure.”[5]\n",

In the latter part of 2003, the band released their debut single, \"Darts of Pleasure\". In January 2004, the single \"Take Me Out\" reached No. 3 in the UK charts. The album, Franz Ferdinand, was released in early 2004, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart in February 2004, and at No. 12 in the Australian album charts in April 2004. The album only reached the lowest levels of the Billboard 200 album charts in the US as of early 2004, but reached the top 5 of the indie rock chart and the Heatseeker chart for debut artists. After a couple of North American tours and heavy rotation of the \"Take Me Out\" video on MTV, the album eventually reached No. 32 on the Billboard 200 later in 2004, and sold over a million copies in the United States.[2] Franz Ferdinand received a generally strong positive response from critics. NME rated it 9 out of 10, and said that the band was the latest in the line of art school rock bands featuring the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Roxy Music, the Sex Pistols, Wire, Travis and Blur.\n",
        "\n",
        "On 7 September 2004, the album was awarded the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. \"Take Me Out\" gained first place in the Australian Triple J Hottest 100 for 2004, winning more than twice the votes of the second-place entry, with This Fire and The Dark of the Matinee entering at No. 24 and No. 50 respectively. Franz Ferdinand won an Ivor Novello Award in 2004 and two Brit Awards in 2005. The avant-garde music video for \"Take Me Out\" earned them a Breakthrough Video MTV Award. NME named Franz Ferdinand the best album of 2004,[7] and placed it 38th on their 100 Best Albums of All Time list.[8] The band performed \"Take Me Out\" as a live medley with Los Lonely Boys, Maroon 5, The Black Eyed Peas and Gwen Stefani at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in 2005, in which \"Take Me Out\" was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Franz Ferdinand was nominated for Best Alternative Album. \"Take Me Out\" was featured on the video games NHL 2005, Madden NFL 2005 and the breakthrough game Guitar Hero.

The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut,[9] but they changed it to You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand before settling on the final title.[10] The album's cover design was modelled on Alexander Rodchenko's 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, \"There's more to life than disco-beat guitar music\".[2] It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics.[11] It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8.

Also included is another video-clip-only single called \"Wine, In the Afternoon\" which is the B-side to \"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\", and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan. \"Do You Want To\" made it to number 4 and was declared by Q to be the greatest single of 2005, while \"Walk Away\" and \"The Fallen\" entered the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart. The fourth and final single from the second album, \"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\", peaked at number 30.

Alex Kapranos has stated that \"The last record was...like a teenager having sex. This one's a bit more assured and a bit friendlier for the dance floor.\"[13] Tonight was mixed by Canadian Mix Engineer Mike Fraser.[14] The song \"Ulysses\" was chosen to be the first single and was released on 19 January 2009. It was first played by Zane Lowe on 17 November 2008. Shortly afterwards it hit YouTube.[15] It did not see that much success in the UK Top 40, reaching only No. 20, but it fared better in Spain and Japan where it reached No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. It also entered the Top 20 of the US Modern Rock Chart. The album, Tonight was released 26 January 2009 and debuted at No. 2 in the UK Album Chart and No. 9 in the US Billboard 200. The second single, \"No You Girls\" saw success both in the charts and on the radio prior to release, eventually reaching No. 7 on the US Modern Rock Chart and was performed by Franz Ferdinand on Comic Relief 2009 Top of The Pops special. \"Can't Stop Feeling\" was released on 6 July as the third single from the album and on 28 August, \"What She Came For\" was released as the 4th single in the form of a remix single.

It's a montage of images; ourselves, pictures and things taken from other places and put together in a strange, abstract way. That's what gives the video that strange, jerky, style\".[69]\n",
