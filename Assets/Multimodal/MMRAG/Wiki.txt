All Quiet on the Western Front (German: Im Westen nichts Neues, lit.â€‰'In the West, nothing new') is a semi-autobiographical novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The book describes the German soldiers' extreme physical and mental trauma during the war as well as the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the war. It is billed by some as "the greatest war novel of all time".[1]
